I tried to keep the video short because it said one to two minutes, but I really did learn alot about importing and taking advantage of different modules.
It was crazy to see how simple it was to setup a graph and to call an API, and collect data from it, once you understood how to use it.
I only had trouble when attempting to fetch data from the API, which required some googling, but I was able to fetch the data with return timestamp and close prices,
which was really simple given how simple the API was to use. It allowed me to call different timeframes, track different stocks, and grab the data from timestamps and
closing prices seamlessly. 
I know this code may not look like a lot, but I really do think that I have learned a lot from it. I've never used these modules before, and it unlocked a new world for 
me for what I can do inside of python. I've only ever been using stuff like import random or something, but I realize that i was able to make my code short due to the 
simplicity that these modules gave me.
I learned how to replace user input with something else, like changing 2024-12-04 to 2024-12-03.
It honestly took more time learning about the modules and how to actually apply them rather than writing the code. I'm not sure if this is bad or not, but I do think
i've learned a lot. I had some initial difficulties about understanding how everything worked, but once it did, it all just clicked.
